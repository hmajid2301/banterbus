# Fibbing It!

## Aim

The aim of the game is to catch the player who is the Fibber. The fibber needs to try to blend in with the other
players. You will be asked a series of questions, the twist being the fibber will be asked a slightly different
question to the rest of the players.

## Rules

1. At the beginning of each round you will shown your role, either a fibber or a normal player
2. Everyone is sent a question to answer
3. The fibber is given a slightly different question to the rest of the players
4. Then you vote on who you think the fibber is based on their answer to the question
5. If everyone votes for the same player, the game will reveal their role
6. If they were the fibber we move onto the next round
7. Players will score points based on avoiding being caught as a fibber or correctly guessing the fibber

## Rounds

There are three rounds, with slightly, different style of questions:

- Free Form: The players will fill out a text box with whatever they want
- Multiple Choice: They will have a set of answers predefined, i.e. Strongly Agree, Agree, ..., strongly disagree (later on, we will be able to customise the answers as well)
- Most Likely: The set of answers a player can pick will be the players in the room (using their nickname)
